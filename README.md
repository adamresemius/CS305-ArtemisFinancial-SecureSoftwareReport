SNHU 305 Artemis Financial Secure Software Report Q & A

Q: What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

A: Artemis Financial was a client that requested a vulnerability assessment of their financial software application. The company wanted to ensure that their software was secure and protected from potential security breaches that could lead to data breaches or financial losses.

Q: What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

A: One challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was determining which mitigation techniques to use after identifying the vulnerabilities. However, I overcame this challenge by increasing layers of security, such as implementing encryption and a Certificate Authority, to provide a more secure software application. I decided to use these materials as each offered a security layer that meets with industry best standards. 

Q: How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

A: To ensure that the server application I developed was secure, I conducted vulnerability testing using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This testing helped me identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the application. In addition, to improve the security of the application, I implemented a REST controller with the "/hash" end tag. This REST controller added an extra layer of security, allowing users to interact with the application using REST methods in a secure manner. By doing so, I ensured that the application was protected against potential security breaches and malicious attacks.

Q: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

A: During the project, I used several resources and coding practices that could be helpful in future assignments or tasks involving developing secure software applications. I utilized the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to identify best practices and tools for securing web applications. Additionally, I implemented HTTPS and Certificates of Authority to encrypt and secure data transmissions. I also used cyphers to secure the data storage in the application. These practices can help ensure that software applications are secure and protected against potential security breaches and attacks in the future.

Q: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignmment?

A: From this assignment, I could provide future employers with evidence of my ability to conduct a vulnerability assessment, identify security vulnerabilities, and implement effective security measures. I could also showcase my knowledge of secure coding practices, security testing, and security risk assessment techniques. Additionally, I could provide before and after code samples that demonstrate my ability to refactor code for security and to ensure that the software application is both functional and secure. Overall, this assignment showcases my ability to develop secure software applications and my commitment to ensuring the security and protection of sensitive data.
